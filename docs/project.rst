Project Summary
===============

Goals Achieved
--------------
Goal 1 - Create a simple blog application.

My goal here was to create a simple blog application using Python/Django. At
minimum, display all posts on the homepage, view details of all posts when
clicked, create a post, and edit a post. All of which I have satisfied :D

Goal 2 - Receive job offer.

My second goal is to write such clean code and documentation that Tivix will
offer me a Python/Django Software Engineering position.

Lessons Learned
---------------

Writing Django apps is nothing new to me, especially blogging applications. What
is new to me is creating well structured documentation. Prior to the assignment,
my documentation consisted of one README.md file that stated the description of
the project, how to run/install, and links to external resources regarding the
project.

After originally submitting my blog application, I pondered ways to improve its
functionality and my (hand written) documentation. After sifting through some
Django projects Tivix had been involved with, I quickly noticed a standard
structure. After some more investigation, I came across Sphinx. How I've been
writing my applications without this godly tool is stil mind boggling.

Some more tools I became privy to were Travis-CI and Coveralls. Again, I'm not too
sure how these tools slipped through my fingers, but very excited to use them in
future projects. 

This is the also first Django project I've coded with a 'deadline'. Writing the app
took about a third of the time spent on this project. Another third was spent
writing the documentation, and the last third was used learning how to cleanly
automate the documentation process. Doing all of this within a week while
working a full time job and handling life obstacles proved to be very
exhilarating learning experience.
